# 🌳 Binary Search Tree Operations in Java

This project is a simple Java implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, showcasing fundamental tree operations using object-oriented programming.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Insert nodes into the BST
- 🔄 Perform Tree Traversals:
  - Inorder (Left → Root → Right)
  - Preorder (Root → Left → Right)
  - Postorder (Left → Right → Root)
- 📊 Count:
  - Total number of nodes
  - Number of leaf nodes
- 📏 Calculate tree depth (height in terms of edges)
- 🔍 Search for a specific element
- ➕ Compute the sum of all node values

## 🧩 Data Structure Overview

- `Node` class: Represents each node in the tree, with `data`, `left`, and `right` references.
- `Treet` class: Contains methods for all BST operations.
- `Main` class: Handles user interaction via console.
